Pd{ bang }  ! put a message on the stack

TUPLE: pd|+ < (pd|arithmetic2) ;  ! declare a subclass
INLET: 1 float (pd|arithmetic2) rhs<< ;  ! define a method

Pd[ + 7 ]  ! put an object on the stack

! There are three ways of replacing the 7 above with 4:
4 over 1 push  ! the object is left on the stack
1 inlet 4 push  ! the object is removed from the stack and gone
1 "test" bind 4 "test" send  ! the object is removed from the stack but lives on
